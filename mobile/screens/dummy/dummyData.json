  "description": "Combating climate change, or figuring out a solution to global warming, is a daunting task that many feel they don't have the means or ways to accomplish. Fortunately each of us has within ourselves the ability to make some smaller (yet significant) changes in our lives that can help make a difference. Instead of becoming overwhelmed at the obstacles which may be presenting themselves, we need to take back control of our own destinies by doing what we can. We have the power within ourselves, if we so choose, to make our immediate environment a better place. As long as each of us made the decision to make a few biofriendly changes, to live life a little greener, or to commit to reducing our carbon footprint, we would likely see the ripple effect of our actions in very little time.",
